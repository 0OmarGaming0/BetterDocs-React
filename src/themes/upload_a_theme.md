## Helpful information
Here's is some helpful information to inform you what each field does.
  - **title** - The name of your theme. `[REQUIRED]`
  - **author** - The name of the author of the theme. `[REQUIRED]`
  - **description** - Short paragraph describing the content and/or purpose of the theme that will appear in the permalink of your page and other places on the site. `[REQUIRED]`
  - **download** - The direct link to the file to be downloaded. `[REQUIRED]`
  - **github** - The link to your [Github](https://github.com/) profile. This will link your name right under the title of your theme. `[OPTIONAL]`
  - **support** - A link to allow people to get support or give feedback for the theme. `[OPTIONAL]`
  - **demo** - This is a direct url to the file so the [demo](https://betterdocs.us/demo/dark.html?theme=INSERT-URL-HERE) can work. For Github it need's to be the **raw** url but to fix the MIME type issue you will need to use [githack](https://raw.githack.com) for the url instead. `[OPTIONAL]`
  - **style** - Values: `dark/light`. This specifies the setting for the [demo](https://betterdocs.us). `[REQUIRED (if using demo)]`
  - **tags** - Tags are in an array and can be seperated with commas "," like so `[tag1,tag2]`. `[OPTIONAL]`
  - **thumbnail** - A direct link to an image that will be the thumbnail and shown on the [themes page](https://betterdocs.us/themes/). (20:11 or 1632x896) `[REQUIRED]`
  - **images** - A list of images that show a preview of your theme. [Imgur](https://imgur.com) is highly recommended for compressed images and reliability. `[OPTIONAL]`
  - **status** - Values: `Updated/Oudated`. The current status of your theme.
  - **auto** - If your theme is hosted on [Github](https://github.com) then add `true` to allow users to automatically down the file (or even the entire repo) instead of just' visiting the site, if hosted elsewhere leave blank or remove it entirely. `[REQUIRED]`
  - **ghcommentid** - ~~The ID of the issue related to your theme so it can be used in our comments system~~. `[REQUIRED]` 
  - **layout** - Used by the [Jekyll](https://api.github.com/repos/MrRobotjs/BetterDocs/) version of this website. `[REQUIRED]`

  1. If your theme is chosen as featured, hereâ€™s what to do next:

  2. Change `featured: false` to `featured: true` or if it doesn't exist yet then add it.
